["introduction.html", "1 Introduction", " 1 Introduction Ovarian cancer has five major histotypes: high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC), low-grade serous carcinoma (LGSC), endometrioid carcinoma (ENOC), mucinous carcinoma (MUC), and clear cell carcinoma (CCOC). A common problem with classifying these histotypes is that there is a class imbalance issue. HGSC dominates the distribution, commonly accounting for 70% of cases in many patient cohorts, while the other four histotypes are spread over the rest of the cases. In the NanoString CodeSets, we also run into a problem with trying to find suitable control pools to normalize the gene expression. For prospective NanoString runs, the pools can be specifically chosen, but for retrospective runs, we have to utilize a combination of common samples and common genes as references for normalization. The supervised learning is performed under a consensus framework: we consider various classification algorithms and use evaluation metrics to help make decisions of which methods to carry forward for downstream analysis.

["methods.html", "2 Methods 2.1 Data Processing 2.2 Classification", " 2 Methods 2.1 Data Processing Normalizing CS2 to CS3 can easily follow the PrOType method for HGSC subtypes because both CodeSets have pool samples. A different technique is implemented when normalizing CS1 to CS3 where we use common samples and genes as reference sets. 2.1.1 Raw Data There are 3 NanoString CodeSets: CS1: OvCa2103_C953 Samples = 412 Genes = 275 CS2: PrOTYPE2_v2_C1645 Samples = 1223 Genes = 384 CS3: OTTA2014_C2822 Samples = 5424 Genes = 532 These datasets contain raw counts extracted straight from NanoString RCC files. 2.1.2 Housekeeping Genes The first normalization step is to normalize all endogenous genes to housekeeping genes (POLR1B, SDHA, PGK1, ACTB, RPL19; reference genes expressed in all cells). We normalize by subtracting the average log2 housekeeping gene expression from the log2 endogenous gene expression. The updated CodeSet dimensions are now: CS1: OvCa2103_C953 Samples = 412 Genes = 256 CS2: PrOTYPE2_v2_C1645 Samples = 1223 Genes = 365 CS3: OTTA2014_C2822 Samples = 5424 Genes = 513 The number of genes are reduced by 19: 5 housekeeping, 8 negative, 6 positive (the latter 2 types are not used). 2.1.3 Common Samples and Genes Since the reference pool samples only exist in CS2 and CS3, we need to find an alternative method to normalize all three CodeSets. One method is to select common samples and common genes that exist in all three. We found 72 common genes. Using the summaryID identifier, we also found 78 common summary IDs, translating to 320 samples. The number of samples that were matched to each CodeSet differed: CS1: OvCa2103_C953 Samples = 93 Genes = 72 CS2: PrOTYPE2_v2_C1645 Samples = 87 Genes = 72 CS3: OTTA2014_C2822 Samples = 140 Genes = 72 2.1.3.1 Overlap of common samples by summary ID 2.1.3.2 Overlap of common genes *Excluding housekeeping genes and controls 2.1.4 CS1 Training Set Generation We use the reference method to normalize CS1 to CS3. CS1 reference set: duplicate samples from CS1 Samples = 25 Genes = 72 CS3 reference set: corresponding samples in CS3 also found in CS1 reference set Samples = 20 Genes = 72 CS1 validation set: remaining CS1 samples with reference set removed Samples = 387 Genes = 72 The final CS1 training set has 304 samples on 72 genes after normalization and keeping only the major histotypes of interest. 2.1.5 CS2 Training Set Generation We use the pool method to normalize CS2 to CS3 so we can be consistent with the PrOType normalization when there are available pools. CS2 pools: Samples = 9 (Pool 1 = 3, Pool 2 = 3, Pool 3 = 3) Genes = 365 CS3 pools: Samples = 22 (Pool 1 = 12, Pool 2 = 5, Pool 3 = 5) Genes = 513 CS2 validation set: CS2 samples with pools removed Samples = 1214 Genes = 365 The final CS2 training set has 945 samples on 136 (common) genes after normalization and keeping only the major histotypes of interest. 2.2 Classification We use 6 classification algorithms and 4 subsampling methods across 500 repetitions in the supervised learning framework for CS1 and CS2. The pipeline was run using many SGE batch jobs as a way of parallelization on a CentOS 5 server. Implementations of the techniques below were called from the splendid package.

The number of randomly selected samples ranges from 1-3 per histotype. Hence, the reference dataset has either 5, 10, or 15 samples and we validate on the remaining. Note that ottaID duplicates are collapsed by mean averaging the gene expression.
