# Introduction

Ovarian cancer has five major histotypes: high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC), low-grade serous carcinoma (LGSC), endometrioid carcinoma (ENOC), mucinous carcinoma (MUC), and clear cell carcinoma (CCOC). A common problem with classifying these histotypes is that there is a class imbalance issue. HGSC dominates the distribution, commonly accounting for 70% of cases in many patient cohorts, while the other four histotypes are spread over the rest of the cases. Subsampling methods like up-sampling, down-sampling, and SMOTE can be used to mitigate this problem.

The supervised learning is performed under a consensus framework: we consider various classification algorithms and use evaluation metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and Kappa, to inform the decision of which methods to carry forward for prediction in confirmation and validation sets.
